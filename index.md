Currently, I am a 3rd year PhD student at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), working in the [Department of Computational Biology](https://cals.cornell.edu/computational-biology), advised by [Andrew Hein](https://cals.cornell.edu/andrew-hein). 

My research interests mostly involve how decision-making, information transfer and movement affect the behavioral aspects of animal groups. In my PhD, I am working on the strategies used by both predator and prey to hunt and escape respectively. I am interested in how these interactions evolve during the initiation of the escape event, and how it affects population demographics. 

To do this, I am developing methods using real-time computer vision models alongside optimised hardware to conduct ultra-low latency closed loop experiments to understand how preys optimise their escape trajectories and to shed light on the computations they do to ensure this.

### My story

Previously, I graduated from the Indian Institute of Science, Research and Education (IISER) Mohali in 2023 with a major in Physics and a minor in Data Science, where my thesis was on "Spatial Variation of Vigilance in Meerkats" under Dr. Ariana Strandburg-Peshkin at Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, Konstanz, Germany. 

When I am not doing science, I like to work out, listen to my favourite podcasts (check out [BtB](https://open.spotify.com/show/0rOatMqaG3wB5BF4AdsrSX)), cook new cuisines, try out board games and explore musical genres. I am a big football fan, and have been watching FC Barcelona play since 2012.
