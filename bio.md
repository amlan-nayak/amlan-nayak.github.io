I am physicist by training with a background in studying animal groups using computational approaches. He is mainly interested in how decision-making, information transfer and movement affect the behavioral aspects of animal groups.

### My story


I am a PhD student at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), working in the [Department of Computational Biology](https://cals.cornell.edu/computational-biology), advised by [Andrew Hein](https://cals.cornell.edu/andrew-hein). 



Previously, I graduated from the Indian Institute of Science, Research and Education (IISER) Mohali in 2023 with a major in Physics and a minor in Data Science, where my thesis was on "Spatial Variation of Vigilance in Meerkats" using computational approahces. 

When I am not doing science, I like to work out, cook cuisines and explore music.
