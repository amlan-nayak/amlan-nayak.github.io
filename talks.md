- **Unraveling Prey Evasion Mechanisms: Interactive Experiments with Zebrafish**
   Abstract: My research investigates the intricate dynamics of prey evasion behavior, using zebrafish as a model organism. By leveraging advanced computer vision models, we've developed interactive experiments that allow us to probe the complexities of escape responses.
