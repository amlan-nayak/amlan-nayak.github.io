- **Unraveling Prey Evasion Mechanisms: Interactive Experiments with Zebrafish**
   Abstract: My research investigates the intricate dynamics of prey evasion behavior, using zebrafish as a model organism. By leveraging advanced computer vision models, we've developed interactive experiments that allow us to probe the complexities of escape responses. This innovative approach combines behavioral observations, neural manipulations, and computational analyses to shed light on the sensory processing, decision-making, and motor control underlying evasion events.
